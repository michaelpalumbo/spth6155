bringing up Said again, example of Heart of Darkness having a lot of 
colonial and racism, and its difficult to do anything with this in 
the text, BUT to look at what came after in response to the work. 


Marcuse, especially in chapter 6, he's against the positivists are 
just another empiricists. it doesn't get 
past what 'is'. 
	- positivists were the teachers in scholars up until the 
1970s. 
	- hegel and marcuse weren't taught until after the 70s 
because positivism reigned.

	- try to keep in mind where he posits critical thinking

KEY: Marcuse is trying to oppose dialectical thought to formal logic 
as it develops in historical contexts, to the point where formal logic 
can be linked to possitivism.

note:

Shannon just mentioned that its important to her to teach things she 
doesn't agree with. <<THIS. :D

John mentioned something great:
	Marcus was a public individual, and like John Dewey it was 
important to him that he isn't just communicating to other scholars. 
	- the idea that someone who isn't intellectual can't begin to 
understand what you're writing is a very problematic assumption. This 
is something ranciere really argued against.

technological rationality is so key to capitalism, it becomes so 
ubiquitous and nebulous that it becomes difficult to parse and make 
changes. so some of the philosphers (marcuse) were able to critique 
technological rationality by criticising the militart-industrial complex. 

Quote from adorno on page 102 of Marcuse . 

page 101-102 linking memory with being a 
"Remembrance of the past may give rise to dangerous insights, and the 
established society seems to be apprehensive of the subversive 
contents of memory. Remembrance is a mode of dissociation from the 
given facts, a mode of 'midiation' which breaks, for short moments, 
the omnipresent power of the given facts. Memory recalls the terror 
and the hope that passed." 
'mode of dissociation from 
the given facts'. 

The hope in Marcuse: dynamic dialectic that works in contradictions, 
and if you asked him 
to think about change, he would identify the problems in the society, 
and try to think outside the norms.

Looking at protests i.e. Kent State ShootingOnce you see the police 
forces coming out firing on citizens, you understand that the system is 
really invested.
	>>>the great refusal: being able to identify what is wrong, 
but not being able/willing to take the steps to do something about it


double-edged nature of abstraction:
	-to have intellectual discourse about something you need to 
abstract it. 
	- abstraction is critical for critical discourse, but has the 
danger of being flipped and used to push for the dominant order. 
	- abstraction is a historical event.
