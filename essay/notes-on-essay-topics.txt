foucault died before he could look at the effects of digital life on humans (from the discussion on marcuse: line 57 of class-notes_marcus.txt)

Technology as a push for efficiency also has an effect on the classroom, because if students are chiefly concerned about their grades as their primary takeaway from the class, then they will only focus on what it takes to get a grade in the most efficient course of action. this works in opposition to being open other aspects of the class that may or may not co-relate to grades but are nonetheless of potential value. (line 60 of class-notes_marcus.txt)	
	-- Does CSCL address or discuss 'efficiency' in the classroom? does it support or detract from it?

through technology our thinking is supplanted by instrumentalization... i.e. a gps does the thinking and navigation for you (see page 141). Stiegler talks about this in automated society. (line 67 of class-notes_marcus.txt)

Shannon's mention of travelling theory: "... that work itself takes on a trajectory of its own, and the people who you don't expect to read it read it anyway, and take it in theor own directions. ... this way you take what you need of [someone like Heidegger] and use if for something [they] didn't address."
	-- Said's Travelling Theory might be crucial to scholarly writing using a VCS? 


What about Marcuse's idea of technical self-administration: as an opposition to public democracy? what does this have to do with interacting with a VCS? the public democracy will be a weapon as long as the will of the people can assert itself. 

Shannon pointed out that where marcuse is concerned with the massification of individuality. the individual is going out toward the mass. <<< as Dcog [3rd-wave?] pushes against individualism

Accelerationist politics
	- distinction between vertical authority and distributed horizontal. 

One of the problems of technology is that we are not capable of determining what technology is capable of because of the way it is enframed, so we need to explode the enframing. 
	- democracy [recall that democracy may be a form of technology] cannot be defined simply by its means -- not via voting, discussion, or general assemblies.
