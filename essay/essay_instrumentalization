instrumentalization


Compare git with a service like dropbox. Git requires users to have more engagement with their actions on files in the repository, as the wrong changes can pose significant challenges to the development of a work.

		Technical self-administration: although the git software places limits on certain actions that can be made by a user. These limitations are often contextual. For example, git prevents two users from pushing changes to the same file, as the second push would overwrite the first. A general practice would require at least one of these users to pull the most recent version of the file, and adding their changes, before being permitted to push. This is implemented with the intention of preventing one user making a problematic change to anothers' work. 

		Despite this, it is still encumbent upon all users to work within this system and propose these changes. Further, where all users have administrative priviledges, it is certainly possible to make such critical -- and irreversible -- changes to the repository as deleting or overwriting the commit history, and [[?]], it is encumbent upon repository members to carry themselves in such a manner as to not make such moves without prior consultation with other members. 

through technology our thinking is supplanted by instrumentalization... i.e. a gps does the thinking and navigation for you (see page 141). Stiegler talks about this in automated society. (line 67 of class-notes_marcus.txt)
