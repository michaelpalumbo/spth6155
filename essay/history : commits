"...in the technological reality, the object world (including the 
subjects) is experienced as a world of instrumentalities. The 
technological context predefines the form in which the objects 
appear. They appear to the scientist a priori as value-free elements 
or complexes of relations, esceptible to organization in an effective 
mathematico-logical system; and they appear to common sense as the 
stuff of work or leisure, production or consumption. The object-world 
is thus the world of a specific historical project, and is never 
accessible outside the historical project which organizes matter, and 
the organization of matter is at one and the same time a theoretical and a practical enterprise." (Marcuse one-dimensional man 223)
