this seciton needs to address and discuss:

positionality and/of distributed cognition

positionality of opensource work -- [this is where self-interest comes in]


<!-- need to describe the git workflow-->
To retrieve the most up-to-date version of the project, a user invokes a pull request, which downloads whatever parts of the remote repository that differ from the local. A creator then makes changes to the items in their local repository, providing comments about changes contemporaneously in the commit history. When a change needs to be added to the remote repository, the <i>push</i> command is invoked. 





As the master archive of a contemporaneous accounting of the development of a work, performed by one or many collaborators, the remote repository persists in the cloud. 

Following Heidegger's circuit of ordering, where

...the standing reserve persists. It persists insofar as it is 
imposed upon for a requisitioning. Directed into requisitioning, 
it is placed into application. Application positions everythin in 
advance in such a manner that what is positioned follows upon a 
result. (Heidegger 25)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The following [[reword]] is a schematization of a distributed version control workflow along Heidegger's ordering circuit of persist-requisition-application. With a pull request, a user requisitions the remote repository from standing reserve and applies it as the starting position for their work going forward. Conversely, the act of pushing a change(s) to a remote repository, in the cloud, is an act of positioning the new state of the repository as a standing reserve. 

The repository as standing reserve will persist -- barring any actions by the user or Github management that would see the repository removed, either willful removal, breach of service contract, or closing of the account, of course.
