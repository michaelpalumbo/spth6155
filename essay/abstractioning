The process of formalizing a thing or collection of things into a routine, or abstraction, means that it will speed some up other thing later on. In this sense, an abstraction can be thought of as a standing reserve. 

From Reed: "As Mateo Pasquinneli has shown, this power of abstraction is an inherent capacity of the organism (including the human brain) to 
invent new norms in relation to dynamic surroundings, recalling 
that a norm is not law, but a conception of law." (535-536) 

Abstraction is the process of taking emergent processes -- or routines -- and turning them into standing reserves. ... What is curious to me is the apparent lacking of inclusion of a tenet of refactoring, or 
perhaps some ofther process of looking at an abstraction and 
determining what -- if any -- of its constitutent parts are 
themselves abstractions [commitments?], and whether their 
inclusion in said abstraction changes them, or if a given 
sub-abstraction nested in the supra-abstraction causes any 
conflict with another nested subabstraction, etc." (My response)
go back to simondon for the technical object. 

"Accelerationism has within itself some of the totalizing aspects of modernism that it itself is trying to criticize." <<< Likely from someone in class, so be careful when using this. 

In this sense, 
the stagnant, alternativeless polis can be diagnosed as 
pathological, since it refuses to adapt to changing epistemic 
conditions." (535-536)
