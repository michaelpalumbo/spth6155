and individualism, which certain waves of distributed cognition push against, I am going to explore its possible importance when it comes to the topic of self-interest. 

i will attempt to show that offering one’s code as open-source in the cloud is actually a self-interested act, and positions oneself, one’s work, those receiving one’s work (other users), and their modifications of the original work, all as resources (or ‘standing reserve’ in the heideggerian sense)

"to position, place, set" (26) can be used to describe "what comes to pass in that requisitioning through which an inventory arises [der Bestand steht] and is thus a standing reserve" (ibid) Where Heidegger positions the 'inventory' as a standing reserve, so to could the repository be considered as standing reserve. The repository is, for some, a record of past work. Through its use as a history [reword], the lognginquity of its contents expands with each additional commit. 



For Heidegger, positionality creates a mental model of spatio-temporal nearness of things. Requisitioning the repositories of other users in the social web of a DVCS like github requires one to navigate pathways of varying spatiotemporal nearness.
