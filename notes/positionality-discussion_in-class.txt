a key idea of this lecture can be found in the third paragraph of page 
27, where Heidegger introduces a "chain of requisitioning"


the lecture on positionality introduces the concept of the concernful 
approach. Following the idea that beyond the material, technology is
 also a way of thinking, the concernful approach depicts a thing's ]
position in relation to oneself and in relation to other things 
also all in relation to oneself. The concerning is that a thing is 
constructed as a mental model in one's mind, so a thing does not 
necessarily need to be in motion for it to concernfully approach. 

It seems that A key characteristic of a concernful approach is its 
directionality, that a thing's becoming unfolds from its beginning as a 
standing reserve through the processes that see it reach its application 
that requisitioned it from standing reserve in the first place. This is 
what Heidegger means when he introduces the term "to position, place, 
set". The direction is that a thing 'arises' as a standing reserve,
then is requisitioned as a resource, processed, and then applied. In the
example on page 25 about a table being made, the table as a thing 
concernfully approaches in bo transportation of lumber --
and in time -- such as through fabrication processes. 



 This direction    
Heidegger states that "Distance lies in concerned approach. The 
concerned approach lies in nearness." (24)
