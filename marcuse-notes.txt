	- tecnocracy: "the technical considerations of 
imperialistic efficiency and rationality supersede the 
traditional standards of profitability and general 
welfare." BUT Need to to define it more, perhaps from 
outside this article


--1. notes on whole article:

'fetish of technique' replaced commodity fetish after 1941

-political neutrality of technique
-possibility of progressive utilization of techniques

'technology is taken as a social process in which technics 
proper (that is, the technical apparatus of industry, 
transportation, communication) is but a partial factor.' 
(138)

this article does not focus on the effect or influence of 
technology on human individuals (138). 

"technology, as a mode of production, as the totality of 
instruments, devices and contrivances which characterize 
the machine age is thus at the same time a mode of 
orgnizing and perpetuation (or changing) social 
relationships, a manifestation of prevalent thought and 
behaviour patterns, an instrument for control and 
domination." (138-139)
