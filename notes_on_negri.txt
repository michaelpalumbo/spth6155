372 - name accelerationism is ...unfortunate as it [claims it 
gives a futurist tone without actually being part of futurist 
manifesto] << its a critique by Negri on accelerationist 
aesthetics. sort of need to sort out the differences between the 
futurists and the accelerationists

acclerationists are : more marxist in orientation

seeing the power in technology as the 

accelerationists see the potential of using technology as a power 
against the system itself. they claim Marx was an accelerationist. 

from accelerationist manifesto "Marx, along with Nick Land, was a 
a paradigmatic accelerationist thinking."
