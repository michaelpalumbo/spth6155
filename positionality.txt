This is now the main file for note-taking on positionality, simply put: for ease of typing!

Definitions: 

what does "longinquity" mean? (page 23)
	- it means remoteness in space or time (Miriam Webster)

what does Heidegger mean when he says "concernfully approach"? 
(24)
	-i think it relates to the way of thinking, that a thing 
approaches us because it is on our mind. we measure its 
distance/nearness to us mentally. 
	- the 'concerned approach attunes the distance 
(longinquity) between what is present within presencing' (23)

Questions:

"nearness is not shortness of distance, fairness is not the length of 
distance." (23)

"Nearness and farness remain equally outstanding" (23)

What one calls distance [Abstand] we know as the interval between 
two points." (23)



Possible question: on page 24, with the quote: "Distance lies in 
concerned approach. The concerned approach lies in nearness." (24) 
Does this imply a directionality in that 
distance>concernedapproach>nearness>observer?
