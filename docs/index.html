<p><h2></h2>

This paper concerns the positionality of a distributed cognition as it relates to self-interest in a technicity of open-source collaborative creation/writing/production. 

<p>
<h3>section: open source collaboration</h3>



<h3>section: describe distributed version control</h3>



<p>
<h3>section: argue for self-interest as pro-accelerationist</h3>

<p>
According to Hiedegger, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The principle of individualism, the pursuit of self-interest, was conditioned upon the proposition that self-interest was rational, that is to say, that it resulted from and was constantly guided and controlled by autonomous thinking. The rational self-interest did not coincide with the individual's immediate self-interest, for the latter depended upon the standards and requirements of the prevailing social order, placed there not by his autonomous thought and conscience but by external authorities. (140)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This paper argues that the notion of an "immediate self-interest" (ibid) of individualism is a driving force inherent to the participation within an open-access social network of ideas and work.

<p>
Users may opt-in to a paid service, offered by the company, that allots a certain number of private repositories, depending on their chosen subscription. While this shows that Github does not mandate that its users expose their work and thoughts to the commons via public repositories, that privacy is the single greatest difference between free and paid accounts suggests that the "...prevailing social order" (Heidegger, page) of Github prefers users engage in open and transparent participation in its social network. But while it may be tempting at first to enframe such a participation as selfless, or perhaprs altruistic, in the act of exposing one's work to peer review, modification, and reification, one not motivated solely by something other than self-interest. The oft-touted idea of "...share early [and] often," (Priem 2013) which forces a creator to push their work into the space(s) of other coginitive and productive millieu(s). As a work ethic, though while interdependent, it is also motivated by self-interests. In the way that positionality links everything as standing reserve, self-interest may be enframed as an ordering (Heidegger, page) of human, artefact, and human-artefact, suggesting that rather than hinder acceleration, individual self-interest relies on and contributes to the efforts and effects of accelerationism. 



<p>
idea of the individual as a resource, page 151 of 'Some Social implications of modern technology' is crucial to this: introduces the shaping of a person into a personality with traits and skills suitable for the completion of certain pre-arranged tasks. This discussion around the intent towards a refinement of a personality or thing as the requisitioning and development of traits and skills can be traced through to the accelerationists, in Reed, with the tenet of abstractify:

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>
	As Mateo Pasquinneli has shown, this power of abstraction is an inherent capacity of the organism (including the human brain) to 
invent new norms in relation to dynamic surroundings, recalling 
that a norm is not law, but a conception of law. (Reed 535-536) 

</BLOCKQUOTE> 







as a system is designed to encourage and promote the free and openness 



Private repositories are available to users that  the social network as a system has several aspects [reword] in place that encourage this activity. 

 it is not required by the
<p>

	-- However: you can possibly challenge this through Said's Travelling theory: one's vcs project, its impossible to predict who will clone one's given repository, and further to predict how it will be interpreted (linguistically, performatively, computationally?, etc?-- likely, yes!), used, modified, broken, etc. but in this way, crucially and possibly in opposition to Marcuse/Heidegger's fears, the individual (user)'s self-interest' IS a standing reserve to another individual user's self-interest. 

	<p>By offering code as a public repository, you offer it, and your future revisions and interactions as standing reserve. when someone forks/clones [be clear and use distinctions of these two to write different threads of thought], they [and their work] also become standing reserves to you, your work, and also to the rest of the github social network. 

	<p>"Where the daily social performance of the individual 
has become antagonistic to his 'true interest', the 
individualist principle has changed its meaning. The 
protagonists of individualism were aware of the fact that 
'individuals can be developed only by being trusted with 
somewhat more than they can, at the moment, do well'; 
today, the individual is trusted with precisely what 
[they] can, at the moment, do well." [what page is this on??] 
>>but this was written before help forums like stack overflow, or subreddits for how-to help -- how can one think critically about the individual, defined as being trusted with more than what they can do at a given moment: suggests that the individual is a worker who learns on the job? does it also suggest that the individual asks for help/ is helped? 
<p>	- what can be asked about the 'performance of the individual'?

<p> use '/Users/mp/code-history-miner/bin/code-miner.sh start' to run code history miner, and then analyse this project's repo, get the charts, like the wordcloud...
