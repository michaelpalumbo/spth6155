A technicity of self-interest in distributed version control projects

<h3>section: open source collaboration</h3>

<h3>The concernful approach of a repository</h3>

Heidegger's example of the carpenter producing a table depicts a thing concernfully approaching in time. (25) That is, it does not approach in distance, but through its fabrication it approaches in time: from standing reserve -- raw materials, such as lumber; to requisitioning, such as its characteristic positioning as a table; to its application as a table. The experience of concernful approach solely in the temporal domain is normalized through many common instances of internet usage, such as page loading, or downloading or uploading content. 
This is consistent also in the context of distributed version control. For example, when making a pull request, where the latest diffs in the remote repository travel over a network connection from the cloud to the local hard disk. In this action, the diffs concernfully approach the user, and is experienced solely as a movement in the temporal domain. Following, for example, a push command, the terminal provides metric feedback about the progress of the operation in terms of percentage, but not in the spatial domain, as there is no detail provided relating to the physical distance(s) travelled by the data. Time is in this situation a technological embodiment. The user <i>waits</i> for the diffs to be transferred. 

As the master record of a contemporaneous accounting of the development of a work, performed by one or many collaborators, the remote repository persists in the cloud. It maintains its longinquity (Heidegger 23) in relation to the local repository(s) and the humans that clone, push, and pull its contents. 

Following Heidegger's circuit of ordering, where

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...the standing reserve persists. It persists insofar as it is 
imposed upon for a requisitioning. Directed into requisitioning, 
it is placed into application. Application positions everything in 
advance in such a manner that what is positioned follows upon a 
result (Heidegger 25)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

were one to apply this flow of the becoming of material objects to the peer-to-peer interactions in a distributed version control social network. 


Certainly there are some examples of direct ordering between a vertical hierarchy of users, as is the case of [[the Linux kernel, with Linus Torvalds as the superior, mandating what the lieutenants and below are to work on...]]

As per positionality as the "...self-ordering" (31) of standing reserves, the distributed version control system in a social network exhibits patterns of decentralized coordinated behaviour. 

The following [[reword]] is a schematization of a distributed version control workflow along Heidegger's ordering circuit of persist-requisition-application. With a pull request, a user requisitions the remote repository from standing reserve and applies it as the starting position for their work going forward. Conversely, the act of pushing a change(s) to a remote repository, in the cloud, is an act of positioning the new state of the repository as a standing reserve. 

Application, according to Heidegger, presupposes a thing's positioning. (25) However, in cases where one cannot predetermine a thing's observer -- or in the Github social network, where one cannot predetermine a repository's potential forker or cloner -- its application cannot itself always be accurately predicted. 

The repository as standing reserve will persist -- barring any actions by the user or Github management that would see the repository removed, either willful removal, breach of service contract, or closing of the account, of course.

It is through the concepts of requisition and conscription that Heidegger would depict the open-source situation as itself a technology. 

"One positioning challenges another, falls upon it with a conscripting. 
This does not proceed by a mere sequence of acts of positioining. 
According to its essence, conscription occurrs in secret and in advance.
 Only for this reason does conscription make possible the planning and 
taking of action upon the individual <><><motives><><> of the particular positionings in a useful manner. But now where does this chain of requisitioning finally run off to?" <<< This paragraph can be used to develop your idea about self-interest because of the word MOTIVES. So need to read next pages of this text.

<h3>section: argue for self-interest as pro-accelerationist</h3>

<p>
According to Hiedegger, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The principle of individualism, the pursuit of self-interest, was conditioned upon the proposition that self-interest was rational, that is to say, that it resulted from and was constantly guided and controlled by autonomous thinking. The rational self-interest did not coincide with the individual's immediate self-interest, for the latter depended upon the standards and requirements of the prevailing social order, placed there not by his autonomous thought and conscience but by external authorities. (140)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

[scholar ___] show that while altruism and [what else] are common factors that motivate programmers to participate in open-source development of code, 
 an "immediate self-interest" (ibid) of individualism is a driving force inherent to the participation within an open-access social network of ideas and work.




<p>
Users may opt-in to a paid service, offered by the company, that allots a certain number of private repositories, depending on their chosen subscription. While this shows that Github does not mandate that its users expose their work and thoughts to the commons via public repositories, that privacy is the single greatest difference between free and paid accounts suggests that the "...prevailing social order" (Heidegger, page) of Github prefers users engage in open and transparent participation in its social network. But while it may be tempting at first to enframe such a participation as selfless, or perhaprs altruistic, in the act of exposing one's work to peer review, modification, and reification, one not motivated solely by something other than self-interest. The oft-touted idea of "...share early [and] often," (Priem 2013) which forces a creator to push their work into the space(s) of other coginitive and productive millieu(s). As a work ethic, though while interdependent, it is also motivated by self-interests. In the way that positionality links everything as standing reserve, self-interest may be enframed as an ordering (Heidegger, page) of human, artefact, and human-artefact, suggesting that rather than hinder acceleration, individual self-interest relies on and contributes to the efforts and effects of accelerationism. 



<p>
idea of the individual as a resource, page 151 of 'Some Social implications of modern technology' is crucial to this: introduces the shaping of a person into a personality with traits and skills suitable for the completion of certain pre-arranged tasks. This discussion around the intent towards a refinement of a personality or thing as the requisitioning and development of traits and skills can be traced through to the accelerationists, in Reed, with the tenet of abstractify:

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>
	As Mateo Pasquinneli has shown, this power of abstraction is an inherent capacity of the organism (including the human brain) to 
invent new norms in relation to dynamic surroundings, recalling 
that a norm is not law, but a conception of law. (Reed 535-536) 

</BLOCKQUOTE> 







as a system is designed to encourage and promote the free and openness 



Private repositories are available to users that  the social network as a system has several aspects [reword] in place that encourage this activity. 

 it is not required by the
<p>

	-- However: you can possibly challenge this through Said's Travelling theory: one's vcs project, its impossible to predict who will clone one's given repository, and further to predict how it will be interpreted (linguistically, performatively, computationally?, etc?-- likely, yes!), used, modified, broken, etc. but in this way, crucially and possibly in opposition to Marcuse/Heidegger's fears, the individual (user)'s self-interest' IS a standing reserve to another individual user's self-interest. 

	<p>By offering code as a public repository, you offer it, and your future revisions and interactions as standing reserve. when someone forks/clones [be clear and use distinctions of these two to write different threads of thought], they [and their work] also become standing reserves to you, your work, and also to the rest of the github social network. 

	<p>"Where the daily social performance of the individual 
has become antagonistic to his 'true interest', the 
individualist principle has changed its meaning. The 
protagonists of individualism were aware of the fact that 
'individuals can be developed only by being trusted with 
somewhat more than they can, at the moment, do well'; 
today, the individual is trusted with precisely what 
[they] can, at the moment, do well." [what page is this on??] 
>>but this was written before help forums like stack overflow, or subreddits for how-to help -- how can one think critically about the individual, defined as being trusted with more than what they can do at a given moment: suggests that the individual is a worker who learns on the job? does it also suggest that the individual asks for help/ is helped? 
<p>	- what can be asked about the 'performance of the individual'?
