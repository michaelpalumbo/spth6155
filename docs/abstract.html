	As an idea is developed, it undergoes varying stages of change, from ideation, through iteration, to application. The texts discussed in the Accelerating Technicity course were concerned with accelerationism, or how an increasingly technological society: influences the evolution of ideas; compells humans into centralized and de-centralized coordinated systems for efficient labor; and impacts the operating relationships between humans and machines. With the proliferation and ubiquity of network-based communications and productivity platforms at the time of this writing, there has been a rise in the development of methods and tools for collaborating with others over the internet. In software development communities, in particular, the need to administer the contributions of multiple collaborators as they make synchronous and asynchronous changes to the elements of a given project, whether in a single location, or from anywhere in the world, is of paramount importance. This problem is resolved by the implementation of a version control system (VCS). 
<p>
VCS archive the current and previous versions of a project in a type of directory called the <i>repository,</i> and facilitate the bidirectional transmission of repository contents between the project directory on computers used by collaborators, referred to as the <i>local</i> repository, and the master copy of the project, referred to as the <i>remote</i> repository. VCS also documents the actions conducted by project members on the contents of the repository, such as making a change to a line of code in one of the files. This means that a repository contains data about the activity and dynamics of its own social network. (Bird et al. 2; Crowston et al 7:2) 

<p> The two models of version control in use are centralized version control (CVC) and distributed version control (DVC). As this paper is concerned only with the usage of DVC for research-creation, please see <a href="https://michaelpalumbo.github.io/self-referent" target="_blank"><i>Version Control Systems as Tools for Research-Creation: Using git to Write a Paper about Using git</i> (Palumbo 2017)</a> for a more in-depth discussion on the differences between CVC and DVC.
<p>
The most prominent DVC service is Github.com (CITE), which hosts millions of publicly available repositories in the cloud, and operates as a social network comprising programmers, educators, students, and designers. 

<p>From the outset of this course, the author maintained all notes and assignments pertaining to class topics, readings, and discussions in a public repository hosted on Github.com, called "spth6155", and is <a href="https://www.github.com/michaelpalumbo/spth6155" target="_blank">available here.</a> This was motivated by a desire to continue investigating the ideas expressed in the aforementioned paper on VCS and research-creation, through the theories discussed in the class, as well as to have a contemporaneous accounting of how the author's ideas developed, as can be witnessed in the exported commit history from this repository:

Drawing from the works discussed in the Accelerating Technicity course, with a particular focus on Heidegger, Simondon, and Marcuse, this paper approaches individualism and collaboration in distributed version control systems (DVCS) through an accelerationist lens. Simondon's genesis of the technical object (Simondon 11), [[short definition]], is implemented to develop a schema of the propagation and reification of ideas throughout a DVCS such as Github.com. A discussion that follows this, on the subject of an individual's experience when interacting with networked data in a computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) situation, is informed by Heidegger's concept of the concernful approach in temporal and spatial domains. The paper concludes with a series of analyses on the data contained within the spth6155 repository in the context of Marcuse's concept of technical self-administration.
