    back on the writing train today. i'm afraid to write about the dvcs, though it needs to be done. my concern is that the paper isn't about DVCS proper, rather it is seeming to become more about individualism and self interest around distributed collaboration. i'm not sure why i'm so afraid to write lately, although at this point i've accepted that i just need to get back to it

    added a section from prior to our assigned sections that Ahsan pointed out, which deals with remembrance and its association/dissociation to established society, which then leads to a quote from Adorno on page 102: 'The spectre of man without memory ... is more than an aspect of decline -- it is necessarily linked with the principle of progress in bourgeois society.' 'Economists and sociologists such as Werner Sombart and Max Weber correlated the principal of tradition to feudal, and that of rationality to bourgeois, forms of society. This means no less than the advancing bourgeois society liquidates Memory, Time, Reccollection as irrational leftovers of the past...' (Adorno, Wes bedeutet Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit?'. Marcuse mentions that 'The struggle against history will be further discussed in chapter 7.'

    really interesting discussion of my section of the class-assigned text of marcuse. you should look at how Dr. Bell compares how marcuse critiques Individualism>Massification with your (me) concern with post-individualism, coming in from the lens of distributed creativity to critique individualism's notion of the genius removed from society, and that Marcuse's text seems to have a fear of losing one's own individualism in a mass, but the text doesn't discuss much of the creative potential of the mass itself.

    forgot to add that two important ideas come up in the notes i just added in the previous commit, which are the 'individual' and their change from individualism proper, to one that is dependent on what marcuse calls the 'appratus' or what i assume to be the technocracy. 2nd idea is that of 'standardization of thought' which is the effect of the apparatus on the minds of individuals, which espouses rationality to the effect that forces of oppositon and their truths become standardized and folded into the apparatus such that they are used to further the interests of that which they purportedly were once against.

    note that heidegger's notion on instrumentality comes from Marcuse's relational instrumentality, which we'll read about in next week's texts. want to highlight that Jay Goulding pointed to the FRAGMENT as a very interesting and significant concept in deeper Heidegger, so look into this later http://www.popmatters.com/column/forays-into-the-fragment-heidegger-and-kant/   also note that Heidegger's focus on the Danger of technology is an assertion that technology homogenizes.

    more on the concerned approach. its as yet unclear what is meant by 'distance lies in concerned approach. The concerned appraoch lies in nearness.' i'm curious if this implies a uni-directionality for the concerned approach. ahhhhh it must be if it is an approach. BUT this section is prefaced by a claim that that which 'absesneces [also] bears the character of what concernfully approaches'

    on page 23 and 24. defined 'longinquity'. now trying to figure out what is meant by 'concernful approach'. my hunch at this point is that it has something to do with the thinking about distance, and a thing's position in relation to oneself, and a thing's position in relation to other things all in relation to oneself. i consider this because of two reasons: first, the 'concern' is a mental state, and two, because Heidegger, at bottom of page 23 talks about how a 'concerned approach attunes the distance ... between what is present within presencing.' in that through concern the concept of a things distance in relation to oneself is 'attuned'. not sure about this, but this is where i'm at
