Notes on "i. Abstract Technical Object and 
Concrete Technical Object"

When Simondon states that "It is difficult ... to define 
the genesis of each technical object, because the 
individuality of technical objects is modified to the 
course of the genesis." (11) what is meant by 
'individuality'? 

"...no fixed structure corresponds to its defined 
use." (11)

"If we begin with the criteria of its [the technical 
object's] genesis we can define the individuality or 
specificity of any technical object." (12)
