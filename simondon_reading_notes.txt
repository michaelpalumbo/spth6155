Notes on "i. Abstract Technical Object and 
Concrete Technical Object"

When Simondon states that "It is difficult ... to define 
the genesis of each technical object, because the 
individuality of technical objects is modified to the 
course of the genesis." (11) what is meant by 
'individuality'? 

"...no fixed structure corresponds to its defined 
use." (11)

"If we begin with the criteria of its [the technical 
object's] genesis we can define the individuality or 
specificity of any technical object." (12)

Seems to say that as a technical object evolves, its 
chratacteristics of "...unity, individuality, and 
specificity ... are consistent and convergent with 
its genesis." (ibid)

KEY >> "The technical object as such is not anterior 
to its own becoming but it is present at every stage 
of its becoming. The technical object is a unit of 
becoming." (ibid)

The footnote on page 12 suggests that 'genesis' and 
a genetic framework as useful for discussing the 
classification of technical objects.
