questioning builds a way. take a class on j. golding.


We would be advised therefore above all to pay heed to the way, and not to fix our attention on isolated sentences and topics.
  - questioning what technology means
  - questioning how technology got to be what it is.
  - makes a distinction betqween tech as we understood it, and framing as we understood it: something happened with modern tech where it became a way of ordering our world as humans.
    - sounds a bit like marx: humans are a part of technology and and they order it.
      - he's seen the rise and fall of the nazis.

Technology has two components:

  - it has a danger. its not hard to see the danger after WW2
      - the way of ordering. its also how we think.
  - and as holderland said: it has a saving potential.
Marcuse also thinks about this:
  - enframing is not how we organize the world. its how we think. with modern technology, it becomes how we think.

poeisis is tech being used for omething that is not instrumental. one of the best ways of thinking about this is in art. tech being used for non-instrumental=art

2nd cause is the formal idea.
3rd is the


is it really true that humanity as a whole drives tech development

John pointed out that Heidegger uses the collective 'we' throughout the paper. when he says the collective we, what he is referring to is the dominant discourse, the hegemony. the dominant discourse in tech thought is the danger discourse.

what is a standing-reserve?

why does freedom come into the discussion?

revealing for heidegger is a way of bringing forth, a way of ordering.
ordering is a way of making technology a priority, and a way of thinking only through the technological model.

heidegger might see neoliberalism as a kind of technology. if technology is a way of thinking, then neoliberalism could be a way of thinking.
  - neoliberalism: comprehensive whole of economic, social, cultural, global way of thinking that is constantly acting and shifting in that it is able to absorb opposition and then put it back out there as part of its shifting, that it is something that we're constantly pushing against.

  - through neoliberalism: the undergrads have built in assumptions that everything is against them, that they are going to be tricked. they have trouble understanding that some teachers don't want them to have a bad grade.


enframing

the real problem of technology is not just the material, its also a way of thinking. so the enframing is really essential. people start thinking about a war economy.


the true is going to match up with the way and liberalism


"The correct always fixes upon something pertinent in whatever is under consideration. However, in order to be correct, this fixing by no means needs to uncover the think ing question in its essence." (6)


truth and the idea of the coin is really useful.

<b>The truth that can be revealed depends on the enframing.</b>


"truth or aluthea, is singular (reducible to a singular thing provided that any plural or sub-truth remains intimately tied to its being)" (Ennar in-class)

important thing to consider in the conext of heidegger is 


enframing:
  - there are different ways of thinking. the examples heidegger gives on page 5, these are all ways of revealing in a certain way. this way is enframing. to bring something forth not as a bringing forth, but as a challenging of. the enframing is basically an instrumental way of thinking.
  - sandra says a great definition is on page 24, and that the example of the idle plane on the runway is a standing reserve, waiting to be put to work. humans are a standing reserve, they are locating within framing, and are relating to the world as a challenging forth. 
  - coneals a former way of revealing
  - what he calls enframing is that inability to get outside of a way of thinking, the idea of not questioning. 

poeisis
  - whereas poeisis is going to be found in art, a different way of bringing forth. 
  - a bringing forth of the material

danger:
  - not being able to think outside of the box. 
  - the danger for heidegger is not being able to think critically. 
  - one of the problems with neoliberalism is that we cannot think outside of it, the only solutions we have are contained within. 

ordering:
  - profit
  - efficiency
  - etc. 

techne:
  - (defined in the thursday lecture)
  
  
  episteme is the how we know. techne links episteme. doxa. 

strip philosophy of all these taints, like questions about politics prevent people from asking/answering questions about philosophy. 

comes so close to saying that enframing is what drive the capitalist war economy. 

logos, or a way of language, is also a way that gathers and brings together and unfolds our things as they appear to us. 

the four ways of being bring something forth into presencing.

THe bringing forth is 

Einar's discussion questions (in looking at pages 20-35):
  - Whether or not, his method for using art in order to save ourselves from technology is itself an 
  instrumentalization and therefore incorrect. (Art broadly defined because he's not just talking about 
  the fine arts here. 
  
  "Heidegger's solution for escaping the danger of modern technology is to embrace a previous understanding of techne, 
  the ancient Greek poiesis of the fine arts. That he provides no exact prescripting approach for thus fostering the 
  growth of saving power in this way, nor guarantees that the arts can actually help us become our own saviour, lays 
  the burden of this task on the reader. But more importantly, as I see it, this ambiguity calls into question heidegger's 
  own method: isn't his solution also an instrumentalization of the poetical? that is to say, aren't the fine arts here merely 
  another means to an end, and thus prone to the same blinding concealing against which he warns?" (Einnar Engstrom 2017-05-09)
  
  
  
  "Can we see connections with other (especially antecedent) theories of technology or history? To what extent is this essay 
  contingent on the time and place of its writing? This question is meant to help ground Heidegger's perspective in his phase 
  of this historical epoch" and "do we find his distinction between 'modern technology and traditional technology' convincing?"(Enngstrom)
    - Could he have gotten to where he was without WWII? 
    - 
  
  our very thinking itself is mimicked by how computers work. 
    - tend to think in a way that doesn't involved critical reflection. 
    - critical reflection itself may not keep up? 
    
    - john responded that its at risk of becoming one. Brought up the Massey commission, reintroducing 
    high culture that the masses could relate to (also cited the "Philosophy of the masses" George Grant). 
    can we brinig in culture to correct pop culture, echoing what heidegger was saying about a force within 
    neoliberalism to self-correct? this is a form of enframing. 
    
    art is a form of poeisis. its a way of not thinking about technology in the dominant way. 


preface by asking about: that we are all from varying disciplines and the discussion has seemed to mostly be 
contained within the text, i just want to ask if i can frame my response from within a conversation in my own discipline(s)?

'long as we hold technology as an instrument we hold it with a will to master.' definition of art for Heidegger: 'highest form of 
techne, a bringing forth ... what is brought forth is a truth in something new ' (narrowly defined from Heidegger on art)
